TokenHunt is a game designed to help improve (human) memory and planning.

The idea behind the game is that a token is hidden amongst a set of boxes. The player has to find the box containing the token by selecting the boxes, one by one.

Once the token is found in a box, the token moves randomly to one of the *remaining* boxes.

The game ends when the following events occur:

1) The player has selected the box which previously contained the token. Since the token never appears in the same box twice, the player has made a mistake.

2) While searching for the token, the player has selected a box twice, out of the set of remaining boxes.

Thus, the player has to remember the boxes that have contained the token previously, and the boxes that have already been (unsuccessfully) selected in the hunt for the token.

The game consists of 23 levels. Once all the boxes in a level have been covered successfully, the game moves on to the next level, with an additional box.
